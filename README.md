# Calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses the [MUI System](https://mui.com/system/basics/) to easily create styled components.

Inspiration taken from:

* [amogh-w/React-MUI-Calculator](https://github.com/amogh-w/React-MUI-Calculator)
* [tuanpham-dev/calculator-react-typescript](https://github.com/tuanpham-dev/calculator-react-typescript)

Currently this calculator only does addition and subtraction, does not take operator precedence into account, and does not retain history.
